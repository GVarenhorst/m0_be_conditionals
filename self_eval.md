# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? 
# I feel very confident in my understanding of comparison operator as well as fluency.
  
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
# I'm somewhat confident in understanding and fluency of logical operators.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
# I'm very confident in understanding and fluency of if statements.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? 
# I spent a decent amount of time on the lesson, but got really caught up in the code challenges. After doing the mild and medium challenges I really wanted to try my hand at spicy, and that took longer than expected. I did them all though, proud of myself for getting them all done even though it wasn't required.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
# Fluency is what needs to be worked on most. Getting used to describing the process and vocalizing what is being done needs to be practiced. I will be repeating these lessons for fluency.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
# I don't have many questions right now, but when I do I will be inquiring with my classmates and mentor and looking up answers. One on one interaction and conversation seems to be most enlightening in the learning process. Matthew and I are going to try working together after class, perhaps make it a habit.
